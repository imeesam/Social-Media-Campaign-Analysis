# Social-Media-Campaign-Analysis
My 3rd Task from my internship at Xpacetechnologies. 
This Streamlit-based dashboard provides interactive data analysis for social media campaigns. Users can upload a CSV file containing campaign data, apply various filters (by region, state, city, and date range), and visualize key metrics such as sales, profits, and other campaign metrics through a series of interactive charts and graphs. The dashboard also allows users to download the original and filtered datasets in CSV format.
